# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
Built a "Twitter Sentimewnt Analysis" on an R script that estimates the live tweets as either positive or negative. This helps the stakeholder or business organizations understand whether their company or product has positive or negative feedback in the market.

Used the package called R Shiny to deploy the model's estimated results in Visual Format to a front-end web application.
